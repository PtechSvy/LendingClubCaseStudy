## Information
# Introduction
Aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario.
Applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services
Understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

We have used EDA to find the factors/driving factors which play the imp role for loan defaults.
According to risk assessment all the future loan will be given.
The goal is to identify what are the factors and documenting those factors.
We have investors,approvers and customer.
If someoneâ€™s loan is rejected, then they are not considered under data set
Default loans are the bad loans ,whereas non default loans are good loans.


# Techniques used :-
Goal of the case study is to find the key factors to decide the loan approval so for that all the data related to customer behavioural attribute are dropped.

We got rid of current loans and consider the fully paid and charged off.

Different types of comparision are done and represented in graphs.

Factors which have been done in this case study are:-
1.Data Understanding
2.Data Cleaning(cleaning missing values,removing redundant columns,cleaning values having NA more than 90%)
3.Data Analysis using different graph and plots(EDA techniques (univariate,bivariate,multivariate))

## Conclusions
After analysing the datasets, there are few attributes of a client with which the bank would be able to identify if they will repay the loan or not.
